# Terraform rules

- Two layers, two lifecycles. `infra/foundation` (registry, key vault, identity, logs, role assignments) changes rarely and is applied by a human after `/slipway:plan dev --layer foundation` and an approval token. `infra/app` (compute + image tags) is applied only by `cd.yml`.
- Always `fmt`, `validate`, then `plan -out=<planfile>`; apply only that exact plan file. Never `-auto-approve`, never `destroy` from a session.
- No secret values in `.tf`, `.tfvars` or state-adjacent files. Secrets are created out of band in Azure Key Vault and referenced by id; runtime access is via managed identity.
- Compute is a swappable module selected by `var.compute` (`aca` here). Do not hard-code compute-specific resources outside `infra/modules/compute-*`.
- Image references use `var.image_tag` (immutable semver) with the registry `acradlcdemo.azurecr.io`; `latest` is rejected by the guard hook.
- Remote state lives in the storage account named in `.slipway/config.yaml` (`azure.state`); never commit `*.tfstate*` or `backend.hcl` with credentials.
- Detailed how-to: the `delivery-knowledge` skill, `references/compute-aca.md`.
