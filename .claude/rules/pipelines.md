# Pipeline rules (GitHub Actions)

- CI and CD are separate workflows. CI builds, tests, computes the version with Nerdbank.GitVersioning, pushes `acradlcdemo.azurecr.io/<app>:<semver>` and publishes a release manifest. CD (`workflow_dispatch` with `tag` and `environment` inputs) deploys exactly that tag.
- Cloud authentication is OIDC federated credentials (`azure/login` with `id-token: write`); no client secrets in repository secrets.
- CD applies `infra/app` behind the GitHub Environment approval; no other job runs `terraform apply`.
- `workflow_run` is not used to pass a tag between workflows (it cannot carry inputs); `/slipway:deploy` triggers CD explicitly.
- Every pushed tag is immutable and traceable to a commit (`sha-<short>` alias allowed alongside the semver).
- Cloud identity in workflows comes only from the repository secrets `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` (exported to Terraform as `ARM_CLIENT_ID`, `ARM_TENANT_ID`, `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` with `ARM_USE_OIDC=true`, `ARM_USE_AZUREAD=true`). Hardened base images are pulled after `docker/login-action` with `registry: dhi.io`, `username: ${{ vars.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}`, `password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}`. No other credentials exist; see `.slipway/SETUP.md`.
